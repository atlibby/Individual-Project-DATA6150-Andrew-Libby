CURRENTLY INTRODUCTION DRAFT MOSTLY COMPLETE
1 Introduction
The topic of research for this report is the global distribution of wealth, and what kinds of factors influence its behavior. Research into this subject is key for understanding and being able to explain, for example, economic disparities among different social groups (citation needed), and being able to identify patterns in these relationships and evaluate them could potentially lead to further research on how to mitigate these disparities. The extent of the world’s wealth inequality and what causes it is an issue that other experts have investigated. Based on results from other studies, there is substantial global economic inequality - the richest 10% of the world’s population owns 76% of global wealth, while the bottom 50% only own approximately 2% of total wealth1. Other research suggests that inequality makes environmental conservation efforts more difficult, and on top of that, environmental policies can even exacerbate these inequalities, leading to a negative feedback loop2. With these points in mind, it is necessary to try to understand what has caused such disparities to exist in the first place by attempting to identify and quantify patterns in data on wealth distribution globally.

2 Data
In this part, you should introduce your datasets.
2.1 Source of dataset
Where did you download it? Is it a credible source? When were the datasets generated? How were the datasets generated by the creator? If you create the datasets, how did you generate it?
Example: xxxx
2.2 Characters of the datasets
What’s the format and size of the datasets? What parameters/columns/rows/character and their units are included in this dataset. Use a table to explain this is recommended. Did you clean the data or convert any unit in the dataset? If so, what’s the formula/rule did you apply? Did you combine any datasets? If so, how do you combine them? Did you create any new category for analysis in the datasets? If so, what and how do you create?
3 Methodology



In this part, you should give an introduction of the methods/model. First, what’s the method/model. What’s the assumption of this method/model. What’s the advantage/disadvantage of this method/model. Why did you choose it. What Python module or function do you apply to apply this method/model. Any optional input/extra work did you adjust to make the results better. If you have multiple methods, feel free to use subsection 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, … to separate them.

Example format: The updated template, user manuals, samples, and required fonts, all are available at the URL https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. It contains said information for all three versions of MS Word (Windows and 2 versions of Mac). There are also separate links to the user guide, which can be referred to by the user. This URL also contains some useful video links, which describe how to add the template, structure the paper, and generate the layout, in different clips. Display Formula with Number
 (1)
Continuation part of Paragraph Text The user must style this paragraph in ParaContinue style, which follows immediately after the DisplayFormula (numbered equation). The DisplayFormula style is applied only in case of a numbered equation. A numbered equation always has a number to its right. Insert paragraph text here. Display Formula without Number

The DisplayFormulaUnnum style is applied only in case of an unnumbered equation. An unnumbered display equation never contains an equation number to its right, and this unique property distinguishes it from a numbered equation.
